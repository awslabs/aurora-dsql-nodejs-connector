# Aurora DSQL with Postgres.js

## Overview

This code example demonstrates how to use the Aurora DSQL Postgres.js Connector to connect to an Aurora DSQL cluster.
The example shows you how to connect to an Aurora DSQL cluster and perform basic database operations.

Aurora DSQL is a distributed SQL database service that provides high availability and scalability for
your PostgreSQL-compatible applications. The Aurora DSQL Postgres.js Connector is a lightweight PostgreSQL client 
built on Postgres.js for Node.js that allows you to interact with PostgreSQL databases using JavaScript code.

## About the code example

The example demonstrates a flexible connection approach that works for both admin and non-admin users:

* When connecting as an **admin user**, the example uses the `public` schema and generates an admin authentication
  token.
* When connecting as a **non-admin user**, the example uses a custom `myschema` schema and generates a standard
  authentication token.

The code automatically detects the user type and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## ⚠️ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the
  minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see
  [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see
  [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Run the example

### Prerequisites

* You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
  configured as described in the
  [Globally configuring AWS SDKs and tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html)
  guide.
* Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js 20+ installed.

```bash
node --version
```

It should output something similar to `v20.x` or higher.

* You must have an Aurora DSQL cluster. For information about creating an Aurora DSQL cluster, see the
  [Getting started with Aurora DSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)
  guide.
* If connecting as a non-admin user, ensure the user is linked to an IAM role and is granted access to the `myschema`
  schema. See the
  [Using database roles with IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/using-database-and-iam-roles.html)
  guide.

### Run the code

The example demonstrates the following operations:

- Opening a connection to an Aurora DSQL cluster
- Creating a table
- Inserting and querying data

The example is designed to work with both admin and non-admin users:

- When run as an admin user, it uses the `public` schema
- When run as a non-admin user, it uses the `myschema` schema

**Note:** running the example will use actual resources in your AWS account and may incur charges.

Set environment variables for your cluster details:

```bash
# e.g. "admin"
export CLUSTER_USER="<your user>"
  
# e.g. "foo0bar1baz2quux3quuux4.dsql.us-east-1.on.aws"
export CLUSTER_ENDPOINT="<your endpoint>"
```

Run the example:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

The example contains comments explaining the code and the operations being performed.

### Connection pooling

Postgres.js uses connection pooling by default. The maximum pool size, and maximum lifespan of connections is configurable 
when the client is created using the options `max` and `max_lifetime` respectively. Note that connections are created lazily only
when a database call occurs, not when the client is created. See [Postgres.js documentation here](https://github.com/porsager/postgres?tab=readme-ov-file#the-connection-pool)
for more information. There are no guarantees as to which connection will be used when executing a command, except within a single transaction.
This means users cannot rely on commands like `SET SESSION search_path=schema` to be applied correctly across multiple database
interactions.
